07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > |

1.  What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > | The Controller in the MVC pattern handles user interactions, updates the data (Model), and refreshes the UI (View) accordingly. |

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > |The Service is responsible for implementing business logic or application functionality that is not directly related to the user interface or data management. |

1.  What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > | The Model manages the application's data and logic, handling tasks like data retrieval, storage, and manipulation |
