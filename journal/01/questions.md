05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | If we add two `!important` they will cancel each other out. |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | Wireframing is creating a basic visual guide for a website or app's layout and functionality |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | For a web dev who is not very creative it would help get a base to build upon. Or just having a web dev who is very creative can save money.    |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | display flex property in CSS is used to create a flex container, which enables a flex layout for its direct children |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | CSS properties that affect the size of a box model include width, height, padding, border, margin, min-width, min-height, max-width, and max-height. These properties control the dimensions of the box itself, as well as the spacing around and inside the box. |
