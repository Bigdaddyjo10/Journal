# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > |synchronous code happens when the execution of operations is done sequentially. asynchronous provides opportunities for a program to continue running other code while waiting for a long-running task to complete  |

02.  What is an event listener?

  > | A function in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur then responds to it |

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | REST interactions between clients and servers, making web services easier to design, implement, and scale. |

1.  What is a callback / higher order function?

  > | Higher Order Function: A function that accepts a function as an argument and/or returns a function as its value. Callback Function: A function that's passed as a argument to another function |

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | A promise in JavaScript is a way to handle asynchronous operations, like fetching data from a server. It represents a value that may be available now, in the future, or never.
  To capture an error from a promise, you can use .catch() or a try, catch block with async/await. |

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | GET, POST, PUT |

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | Application Programming Interface |

08.  What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | asyn |

1.  What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > | To bundle data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit |

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | 200 OK |

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | bad request error. when sends a request to a web server that the server cannot understand |
